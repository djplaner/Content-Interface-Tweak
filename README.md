## Why?

Creating content in Blackboard Learn is painful and produces ugly content that is not maintainable. No real support is provided for standard authoring functionality (e.g. version control, grammar checking, citation management etc.) No surprise then that most people upload documents (PDF, Word, PowerPoint etc.).

## What?

The Content Interface enables

1. Use of Microsoft Word to create content.
2. Conversion of Word into HTML
3. Javascript/CSS that transforms the HTML in various ways.

See [this blog post](https://djon.es/blog/2019/02/24/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning/) for more detail on why and how it works.
