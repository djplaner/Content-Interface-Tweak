No real support is provided for standard authoring functionality (e.g. version control, grammar checking, citation management etc.) No surprise then that most people upload documents (PDF, Word, PowerPoint etc.). See the Content Interface section of this paper for more detail. The example Word document provides more detailed instructions and background. What? # The Content Interface enables Use of Microsoft Word to create content. Conversion of Word into HTML Javascript/CSS that transforms the HTML in various ways. See this blog post for more detail on why and how it works. Editing content in Word # Transformed HTML in Blackboard Learn # How to use it with Blackboard Learn? # The following instructions are specific for Blackboard Learn (the basics apply to other technologies) and focus on how to prepare a Content Area to host/display the HTML content. Step 1 - Add the Javascript/CSS # The transformation of the HTML relies on some Javascript/CSS which needs to be included in the Blackboard Learn page. To do this: Add a new Blackboard content item to the page Paste the content of the tweak.html file into the content item As this is HTML code, you will need to use the HTML button before pasting. Step 2 - Add space for your content (HTML) # Add a Content Item ( Build Content > Item ) give it the title Content Interface Step 3 - Create/update a Word document # A standard Word document will work. However, there are additional styles used to implement certain features. The example Word doc provides more detail on these styles and using Word.

Your content is never placed onto another computer. Copy the HTML produced by Mammoth into your clipboard. Return to Blackboard Learn and paste the HTML into the_Content Interface_item you created above Make sure the Content Editor is in advanced mode. Click on the HTML button Paste the HTML into the window that pops up Save the changes and return to the page Repeat steps 3 and 4 every time you make a change # Never change the contenet in Blackboard. Always make the change in Word first and then update Blackboard. Semi-automating the update process # If the Word document is shared (e.g. via OneDrive) then it is possible to semi-automate the update proces as illustrated in the following image. To do this: 1. Use OneDrive (or SharePoint) to create an appropriately shared link to the document 1.
