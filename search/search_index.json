More information about the rationale and design of the Content Interface is available in a paper (Jones, 2019) and this blog post . In summary # As observed by others ( Pardo, 2015 ) Creating learning resources is getting incredibly diffficult. Gone are the days in which a bunch of PDFs or PPTs were the only resources available to students. In a matter of years, learning resources have to be engaging, interactive, render in all sorts of devices The Content Interface Allows you to use common authoring tools (Microsoft Word and its associated ecosystem) to create and maintain content. Transforms that content into a more contemporary and interactive interface for readers. What? # The Content Interface is a collection of different technologies ( all available here ) designed to be integrated with Blackboard Learn , Microsoft Word, the broader Office365 suite, and your approach to creating and updating learning content. This page has been produced using the Content Interface. All of the content here is created and edited using Microsoft Word and the associated ecosystem. For example, the Zotero citation management software is used to manage the references. Embedding and sharing design knowledge # Beyond technology integration, the Content Interface enables embedding within it a range of different design knowledge that improve quality while reducing workload requirements. For example, knowledge of Griffith University trimester calendar. This means dates can be written in the Word document in terms of trimester weeks - e.g. Wednesday, Week 1 . But when displayed in Blackboard Learn, a calendar date specific to the current course site will be inserted. The images below show how the previous paragraph appears in Microsoft Word (Figure 1) and in Blackboard Learn (Figure 2). Figure 1 - Paragraph in Word showing \"University Date\" style Figure 2 - Same paragraph as Figure 1 displayed in Blackboard showing automatic insertion of trimester specific date. Why? # The content provided by a course is known to have a significant influence on students\u2019 perceptions of course quality (Peltier et al., 2007). Failing to leverage affordances of the online environment can create a disengaging student experience (Stone & O\u2019Shea, 2019). Creating high quality course content that fully leverages the affordances of the online environment is difficult and Blackboard Learn does little to help. Blackboard\u2019s lack of support is known to encourage teaching staff to avoid the interface by using offline documents and slides (Bartuskova et al., 2015) and has been discussed amongst the community of Blackboard users. The Content Interface aims to provide explicit support for creating and maintaining online learning content, it is hoped that the content interface will: Reduce the workload for all involved. Lift the quality of what can be produced. Improve both the learning and teaching experience. Perhaps, eventually, improve learning outcomes. By starting with Word documents, the process harnesses existing widespread academic familiarity with Word and associated tools (e.g. citation management with EndNote). It inserts the ability to automatically transform and uplift that Word content into a quality online format. That transformation is flexible and we\u2019ve only touched the surface of what could be done. References # Bartuskova, A., Krejcar, O., & Soukal, I. (2015).

One way to do this is to use indirect links to Blackboard content items . While such links can be safely copied from one offering to another, they offer no other functionality and are not visually appealing. Another way to do this is via the Card Interface . It provides a way to indirectly link to Blackboard content items that can also be safely copied from one offering to another. It also provides additional functionality, including: A more visually appealing, contemporary interface appropriate for computers and mobile devices. Grouping and numbering links (cards). Embedding videos and other live content. Display dates , including dates based on the university trimester calendar. Working with the Blackboard Review Status functionality. A \u201ccoming soon\u201d ability . A concrete example # Assume you have a single assessment item that covers five different quizzes to be completed by the students. You use the Content Interface to provide information about this assessment item, including links to the five individual Blackboard quizzes the students will complete. There are two ways you can provide these links. You can use links or cards. Figure 1 and Figure 2 provide a concrete example of the two approaches. Using links # Figure 1 is one way to implement this example using Blackboard Content Links . The Quiz availability column contains Blackboard Content Links to each of four quizzes. The link destinations for these four links are content items on this Blackboard page (the Content Interface hides them from students when Edit Mode is off). The link destination matches the name of the item (i.e. Quiz 1 ; Quiz 2 ; Quiz 3 ; Quiz 4 ). An item may not be available to students because it has not been added to the page, or because adaptive release has been applied. An unavailable item will be displayed as (not currently available ) e.g. Quiz 4 in Figure 1. Figure 1 - Using Blackboard Content Links to display four Blackboard quizzes Using Cards # Figure 2 is using cards to display information about and links to the same four quizzes, including show off some of the additional card functionality. Figure 2 - Displaying details and links about four Blackboard quizzes using cards How to add cards to the Content Interface # The following assumes you have set up the Content Interface on a Blackboard content area. There are four (one optional) steps to add cards to the Content Interface: Add the card Content Items to the content area. Configure the card interface (optional). Add the cards to the Content Word document. Update the Blackboard content area. Each is explained in the following sections using the example of translating Figure 1 (links) into Figure 2 (cards). Add the \u201ccard\u201d Content Item(s) # Each \u201ccard\u201d is a visual representation of a Blackboard content item on the same Blackboard content area (page) as the Content Interface. A \u201ccard\u201d Blackboard content item must be customised with at least one \u201ccard meta data variable\u201d . Each variable controls the display and form of a card component . Example # Figure 3 shows part of the Blackboard content area from Figure 1, but with Edit Mode on. This displays the four content items for the four quizzes. This example is working with this page where the content items already exists. In this case, no need to add these items. All that is required to add card meta data to the existing items to indicate that they should be displayed as cards and how they will be displayed. Figure 3 - \"Normal\" Blackboard content items before being customised as cards Figure 4 shows how the first of the content items (Quiz 1) from Figure 2 has been customised to achieve that cards displayed in Figure 2. The following table summarises the changes and their impact. The included links are to the more detail documentation for the Card Interface associated with the specific change. Change Impact Change content item name (Quiz 1 to Quiz 1: Loops and repetition) Provides a more meaningful card name and work better with the card label Card Image Is required to identify the item as a card. Specifies the URL for the image to be displayed for the card. Card Date Specify the card\u2019s date element as the Thursday of Week 5 of this course site\u2019s Griffith University study period. i.e. the date the quiz will close. Card Date Label Change the date label from the default ( Commencing ) to Closing 5pm Card Label Change the card label from the default ( Module ) to Quiz . Card Coming Soon Indicate that the card should remind students that it is only available for use from Monday (12:01pm) of Week 4 through to 5pm on Thursday of Week 5. The week\u2019s apply to the course site\u2019s Griffith University study period. Figure 4 - First content item from Figure 3 customised by adding card meta data Configure the Card Interface # Customising individual content items customises how individual cards are displayed. However, there are instances where you wish to customise how the Card Interface (i.e. all the cards) are displayed. For example, Figure 5 shows the default view of the cards once they\u2019ve all been configured as in Figure 4. At least, when they are being viewed on March 25. Since it is March 25 the first quiz is available for students. The remining quizzes are not. By default, the cards are shown three to a row. This is not what is shown in Figure 2 where there are four cards per row. To make this change we need to customise the Card Interface. This is done by: Adding to the Blackboard content area an empty content item named Card Interface . Customising that content item using card templates and attributes . Figure 5 - Default quiz cards Example # Figure 6 shows the creation of the Card Interface content item for our example. It is using two attributes described in the following table. Compare Figure 5 (the default configuration) with Figure 2 (with this configuration). Attribute Purpose engage=\u201dStart Quiz\u201d Change the \u201cEngage\u201d button label on each card to \u201cStart Quiz\u201d by4 Show four cards per row, rather than the default 3 Figure 6 - Configuring the card interface using templates and attributes Add the cards to the Content Word document # The cards you wish to display can occur anywhere in the Content Interface. To specify where the cards appear, you create a list of Blackboard Card _names. i.e. a list of names that match the names of the content items you wish to link to.This is done by applying the _Blackboard Card style in the Word document. Example # Figure 7 shows the Word document used to create the content interface shown in Figure 2 and Figure 5. The four item list under the heading Quiz Details has had the Blackboard Card style applied to it. Each of the items contain text that exactly matches the names given to the Blackboard content items for the quizzes. e.g. Figure 4 shows the content item for the first item in the list in Figure 7. Both have the same name Quiz 1: Loops and repetition . Figure 7 - Word document with a single Blackboard Card list Cards can be added multiple times throughout a content interface document. They can also appear in any order. Whenever the Content Interface sees a Blackboard Content item in a Word document it will attempt to replace it with a card in Blackboard For example, Figure 8 shows a modified version of the Word document from Figure 7. Another Blackboard Card list has been added at the bottom. Figure 8 - Word document with two lists of cards Figure 9 shows what this Word document looks like on the web in Blackboard. After the heading Quiz details \u2013 Just the odd quizzes you can see two more cards which are the same as the matching cards in the first list of cards. Figure 9 - The web version of the multiple card list document in Figure 8.

Blackboard provides an array of content, assessment (assignment submission points, quizzes), other tools (e.g. discussion forums etc.) and other functionality (e.g. adaptive release , Review Status , course links etc.) that are an important part of a course site. You will want to provide access to and use this Blackboard content, tools and functionality in your content. The following shows how, including: Two different ways of creating indirect links to Blackboard resources Indirect link to a menu item \u2013 Blackboard Menu Link style. Indirect link to a content item \u2013 Blackboard Content Link style. Using Review Status . Using Adaptive Release . Direct links will create problems when copying course content # You can link directly to a page on Blackboard, just like any other page on the web. But it\u2019s a bad idea. A direct link looks like a normal web link e.g. https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_82534_1&content_id=_5578514_1 Course copies break direct links # Most Blackboard sites are trimester or study period specific. The next offering of the course will have a different Blackboard site. With different URLs. This means that any direct links from previous offerings will not point to the new course site. They\u2019ll still point to the old site. Indirect links work with course copies # The methods shown below work safely across course copies. Indirect link to a menu item \u2013 Blackboard Menu Link # Every Blackboard course will have a course menu. For example, Figure 1 shows one course menu. Each course menu consists of menu items. Figure 1 includes menu items like: Welcome; Workshop Resources; and, Collaborate Ultra. The Blackboard Menu Link style provides a way to link indirectly to items in the Course Menu. Figure - Example Blackboard course menu To use the Blackboard Menu Link style you: Write the text to which you will add the link. Identify the name of the menu item to like to. Create a link with that name as the destination. Apply the Blackboard Menu Link style to the link. The following sections illustrate 1. Write the text # For example, the following quote Participate in online tutorials by using Collaborate Ultra. Where I\u2019d like using Collaborate Ultra to be a link. 2. Identify the name of the menu item # I\u2019d like using Collaborate Ultra to link to the same place as the Collaborate Ultra menu link shown in Figure 1. Hence the name I\u2019m interested in \u2013 Collaborate Ultra 3. Create the link # Use Microsoft Word\u2019s ability to create a link using the outputs of the previous two steps. As shown in Figure 2. Participate in online tutorials by using Collaborate Ultra . Make sure the name and the link match The Content Interface tries to make an exact match. If the link you\u2019ve used doesn\u2019t match exactly one of the menu item names. A link will not be created. Figure - Creating the link 4. Apply the Blackboard Menu Link style # The link created in the previous step is a normal link. i.e. it will search for a web page with the URL Collaborate Ultra . It will fail. We need to tell the Content Interface that this is not a normal link. It is in fact a Blackboard Menu Link . We do this by applying the Blackboard Menu Link style to the link. i.e. select all of the link and then choose the Blackboard Menu Link from the styles menu. If your Word document is using an appropriate template then the colour of the link should change in line with what you see in Figure 3. The normal link (Microsoft Word\u2019s ability) is blue and underlined. The Blackbard Menu Link (using Collaborate Ultra) is red and underlined. Figure - Result of applying the Blackboard Menu Link style Indirect link to content item \u2013 Blackboard Content Link # Blackboard Content Areas are commonly used to organise lists of content items. The Content Interface is typically implemented as two or three content items in a content area. Other content items and tools can be added to a Content Area. Many of those content items and tools are links elsewhere in Blackboard. For example, Figure 4 shows an example content area showing four content items with titles, including Content Interface \u2013 the item that contains content produced by the Content Interface. Chat about the content interface \u2013 a discussion board. Take a quiz \u2013 a quiz. Testing \u2013 another content area. The titles for each of the last three content items shown are underlined. Indicating that these titles are also links. If you click on these links, you are taken to the relevant discussion board, quiz, or content area. This section illustrates how you can use these items to create links within the Content Interface. Allowing you to create indirect links to elsewhere in Blackboard. Figure - Example Content Area For example # The following assume that the aim is to link to a discussion board. For example, the following where if you click on the link you will be taken to a discussion board to share your response. Share your responses in the discussion board. The four steps of this process is essentially the same as the four steps of the previous section. The only difference here is that rather than using a menu item to find the link, we\u2019ll be using a content item. 1. Write the text # The first step is to write in the Word document the text where the link will originate. E.g. Share your responses in the discussion board. 2. (Create and) Identify the name of the content item # To use this approach there has to be a content item on the current page in Blackboard that provides the link we wish to use. In this case, we\u2019d like a link to the discussion board. Meaning a discussion board item needs to be added to the content area . For example, Figure 5 shows that a discussion board linked named Discussion Board has been added to this page. You need to know the exact name of the content item to create the link. Figure - Example discussion board added to a content area 3. Create the link # Use Microsoft Word\u2019s ability to create a link using the outputs of the previous two steps. As shown in Figure 6. Share your responses in the discussion board . Figure - Adding link to content item Beware Word special characters \u2013 copy and paste Matching the link address and the item name is an exact match. Maximise is different to maximise . Microsoft Word automatically replaces some text characters with others. For example, smart quotes and hyphens and dashes . This can create some less than apparent differences. When adding the content type to the Blackboard page, rather than type the name, copy and paste it from Word. Beware creating links in the online version of Word Experience suggests that the online version of Word doesn\u2019t create links the same way as the desktop Word application. 4. Apply the Blackboard Content Link style # The link created in the previous link is a normal web link. As such, it will not work as it stands. To make it work as an indirect link the Blackboard Content Link style needs to be applied to the link (e.g. Figure 7) Figure - Applying the Blackboard Content Link style If the Blackboard Content Link style is applied correctly in a document that is based on a template, then the colour of the link will be black. For example, Figure 8 shows the difference between a normal link (blue underlined) and a Blackboard Content Link (black underlined) Figure - Different appearance of Blackboard Content Links Integrating the Blackboard \u201cReview Status\u201d feature # The Blackboard Review Status feature provides a way for students to mark items as reviewed and for teaching staff to track how students have marked items as reviewed. Integrating the Content Interface with the Review Status feature allows students to mark specific accordions (sections) as reviewed. For example # This section (Integrating the Blackboard \u201cReview Status\u201d) has been set up to enable \u201cReview Status\u201d. When viewed in Blackboard it will appear as shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10. These two figures show the two status of Review Status Mark Reviewed; and i.e. the student has yet to mark this section has reviewed Reviewed. i.e. the student has marked this section as reviewed Figure - Review status turned on - Waiting for student to Mark Reviewed The two figures illustrate the two components added when Review Status is enabled: Status label; and The heading of the section has a label added to indicate the status of the section \u2013 reviewed or not Action button. The first content within the section is now an action button that allows the student to toggle whether the section is reviewed or not. Clicking on the Mark Reviewed button (Figure 9) results in the section to be updated to be Reviewed (Figure 10). Clicking on the Reviewed button (Figure 10) will result in the section being updated to unreviewed (Figure 9) Figure - Review status enabled - Student has marked as reviewed Steps to turn on \u201cReview Status\u201d # The following sections outline the 5 or 6 steps to enable \u201cReview Status\u201d 1. Identify which Word document heading(s) you will apply \u201cReview Status\u201d # The Content Interface allows you to turn on \u201cReview Status\u201d for specific (accordion) sections of your Word document. The start of (accordion) sections is indicated by their heading ( Heading 1 or Heading 2 style) and a section includes all content up until the next heading of the same level. To turn \u201cReview Status\u201d on for a section, you first have to identify the full text of the relevant heading. In this example, I wanted to enable \u201cReview Status\u201d for this section. The full text of the heading for this section (a Heading 1 style). The text of that heading is Integrating the Blackboard \u201cReview Status\u201d feature I\u2019ve copied that text into the clipboard. Beware special character \u2013 use copy and paste Typically, Microsoft Word will automatically convert certain characters. For example, quotes will be come smart quotes and (some) hyphens will become em/en dashes . Blackboard does not do this conversion. You may not notice the difference, but software does. While you may think you\u2019ve typed in the name of the heading, you may have missed some of these auto conversions. To avoid this problem, copy the text of a heading. 2. Change the heading style # Normally, headings that define accordion sections will have either the Heading 1 or Heading 2 styles applied. To use the Blackboard \u201cReview Status\u201d the styles need to be changed to either the Blackboard Item Heading or Blackboard Item Heading 2 styles. This \u201capply styles\u201d page shows how to apply a new style. To help distinguish between these two sets of heading styles, the default Content Interface template makes them look different. Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles will use a larger, blue font (Figure 11) Figure - Heading 1 style In contrast, the Blackboard Item Heading and Blackboard Item Heading 2 styles will use a white font on a black background (Figure 12). Figure - Blackboard Item Heading style Blackboard Item Heading sections will be initially hidden from students The Blackboard Item Heading styles are intended to be paired with a matching Blackboard content item (the next step is creating one). If there is no matching Blackboard content item for a Blackboard Item Heading element, then the whole section will be hidden from students (but visible to teaching staff). For more information, see the Change the styles section in the Using the adaptive release function section below. 3. Add a Content Item to the page with the same name # \u201cReview Status\u201d is a Blackboard feature. It has to be applied to an item within a Blackboard course site. Hence to enable \u201cReview Status\u201d for your section, you need to add a content item in Blackboard with the same name on the same page as the Content Interface. Figure 13 shows the process of adding a content item to the Blackboard page on which this document has been placed. The name matches the text of the heading of the section. The body of the content item can be left empty Figure - Adding a content item matching the section With Edit Mode on this newly added item will appear on the page (e.g. see Figure 14). However, when Edit Mode is off (i.e. when viewed by students) this item will be hidden. Its only purpose is to track whether \u201cReview Status\u201d has been enabled. Figure - Blackboard content item added with name matching section title 4. Turn the review status for the content item # Initially, a new content item does not have \u201cReview Status\u201d turned on. Hence the next step is to turn \u201cReview Status\u201d on . Once you have done this, the content item will be modified to indicate that it has been enabled (see Figure 15). Figure - Content item showing Review Status enabled If you look closely at Figure 15 you will see that while \u201cReview Status\u201d has been enabled, the matching accordion in the Content Interface (above it) does NOT have the \u201cMark Reviewed\u201d status label showing. Review Status only appears with Edit Mode off In Figure 15, Edit Mode is on. This is why we can see the newly added content item at the bottom. It\u2019s also why we can\u2019t see the \u201cMark Reviewed\u201d status label. 5. Check that it works \u2013 Turn Edit Mode off # To check that \u201cReview Status\u201d has been enabled, you need to turn Edit Mode off. With Edit Mode off, if everything is working, then the \u201cMark Reviewed\u201d status label will show on the appropriate accordion heading and the content item will not show (Figure 16). Open up the accordion and should see the \u201cMark Reviewed\u201d button (Figure 9). Figure - Checking \"Review Status\" is working with the Content Interface - turn Edit Mode off 6. (Optional) Change the text on the \u201cReview Status\u201d label and button # As shown above, when you turn on \u201cReview Status\u201d a \u201cReview Status\u201d label and button will be added. By default, the label and button will use the text Mark Reviewed; and, To indicate that the student has not yet reviewed the section. Reviewed. To indicate that the section has been reviewed. One or both of these default texts can be changed. You do this by adding parameters to the name of the Content Interface item. This is the Blackboard item into which the converted Word document content is pasted. For example, Figure 17 shows a page (with Edit mode on) where labels have been changed to Completed and Not Completed . Figure - Changing text for \"Review Status\" label and buttons With Edit Mode off, the \u201cReview Status\u201d label and buttons will show Not Completed (Figure 18) Figure - \"Review Status\" showing change to \"Not Completed\" And Completed (Figure 19) Figure - \"Review Status\" showing change to \"Completed\" Using the adaptive release function # Blackboard\u2019s adaptive release function enables teachers to define a set of rules that govern if and when content is available to students. Adaptive release can be used to hide sections in a Content Interface document. For example, hide this section # I might decide that I want to hide this section (titled For example, hide this section ) from all students using adaptive release. (Note: this isn\u2019t in effect now so that you can see this section) After I have followed the steps below to hide this section, if I view this page with Edit Mode on I will still see this section (Figure 20). Figure - Blackboard Item Heading section with adaptive release applied (Edit Mode on) However, if I turn Edit Mode off and the adaptive release is configured to only release content to members of a group (to which I do not belong) then I will not be able to see this section in Blackboard (Figure 21). Figure - Blackboard Item Heading section with adaptive release applied (Edit Mode off) The following sections talk about the 5 steps required to get this to work. This mirrors largely the process used to enable \u201cReview Status\u201d described above. 1. Select the section you wish to hide # Like \u201cReview Status\u201d (above) adaptive release is applied to sections of your Word document. These sections are defined by headings. Adaptive release can only work on the top two levels of headings (heading 1 and heading 2). In this example, the section I wanted to hide was the section above with the heading For example, hide this section I copied this text into my clipboard. 2. Change the styles # Normal Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles will not work with Blackboard functionality like \u201cReview Status\u201d or \u201cAdaptive Release\u201d. If you want to apply adaptive release to a section, you need to change its style from Heading 1 to Blackboard Item Heading ; or, Heading 2 to Blackboard Item Heading 2 . If you have made this change, but not completed the next step (creating a matching Blackboard content item) then when you view (with Edit Mode on) the Blackboard page you will see something like Figure 22. Note how the title of the section has had automatically added the following text. (not currently available \u2013 will be hidden from students) With Edit Mode off, this section will by default invisible to students. Figure - Blackboard Item Heading section without a matching Blackboard item (and Edit Mode on) 3. Create the matching Blackboard content item # \u201cAdaptive Release\u201d is a Blackboard feature. It is applied in Blackboard to a Blackboard content item. Before you can use adaptive release with the Content Interface, you need to add a Blackboard content item to the same page as the Content Interface, with the same name as the section you identified in Step 1. The Add a Content Item to the page with the same name section in the \u201cReview Status\u201d section above has more information. 4. Create the adaptive release rules # Initially, a newly created Blackboard content item does not have any adaptive release rules applied. You will need to apply appropriate adaptive release rules . With Edit Mode on, Blackboard will indicate if adaptive release rules have been applied to an item (Figure 23). Figure - Blackboard content item with adaptive release applied 5. Check that it works # At the very least, to check if the adaptive release is working you will need to turn Edit Mode off (Figure 21). However, this will not always work. It will depend on whether or not the adaptive release rules are met. For example, you may not be able to test whether members of a particular group can see a section because you are not a member of that group. Similarly, you may not have submitted an assignment, achieved a particular grade etc.","title":"Blackboard"},{"location":"creating/blackboardContent/#creating-blackboard-content","text":"","title":"Creating Blackboard content"},{"location":"creating/blackboardContent/#what","text":"Currently, the Content Interface is designed to be embedded within the Blackboard Learn system (Blackboard).

Problem: What happens when your course content gets rolled over into another trimester or study period? A study period that has different dates.

The Griffith University Library provides methods by which learning resources \u2013 such as films \u2013 can be sourced for use in courses. Problems: While many films can be provided to students to watch online, not all of them can. The variability of what can be provided complicates that task of explaining to learners what films to watch and how. it also means that as films become available to watch online, the course writer needs to remember what online materials need to be updated. The Film Watch Options functionality aims to semi-automate and simplify this process. For example # Here\u2019s a list of films with various availabilities. Watching via Griffith University The options to watch the following films are provided via Griffith University. Hence are only available to students and staff of that university. American Beauty # Rear Window # You can watch Rear Window on Kanopy Thelma and Louise # We've been unable to provide a copy Thelma and Louise . This search on JustWatch may provide pointers to where you can find it online.

Note how each film is represented differently depending on if and how the video is available. For example, American Beauty is available to play via an embedded video player from Stream. Rear Window is available to play via a link to the Kanopy service. Thelma and Louise is not available to play. Instead, a link is given to a search for options to watch Thelma and Louise online. If and how a film is available to play is configured in an Excel spreadsheet (more detail below) Figure 4 - How \"Film Watch Options\" appears on the Web How to do it # This process is reasonably complex, especially the first time. You may wish to seek out additional assistance through means you normally follow. Griffith University Specific Some of the following information is Griffith University specific.

The titles provide an overview of the content and a mechanism by which focus is applied to specific parts of the content. There are two levels of accordions The Content Interface supports two levels of nested accordions. All the accordions you can see in Figure 2 are level 1 accordions. These are specified using a Heading 1 style in the Word document. Level 1 accordions can include further accordion sections. Each of these further accordion sections are Level 2 accordions. Specified in Word using a Heading 2 style. The following explains Which accordion is open for the first visit. Which accordion is open all subsequent visits. How to stop auto scrolling to the open accordion. How to change which accordion opens for a visitor. How to open or close all the accordions. How to remove the accordions. Which accordion is open for the first visit # The first time you visit a page with the Content Interface the default behaviour is for the first top-level accordion to open and for the page to scroll to the top of the top-level section (see image below). Which accordion is open for all subsequent visits # When using the same web browser (on the same device) the Content Interface remembers which accordion you last opened. When you return to a page (using the same web browser on the same device) it will open that accordion and scroll to the top of the matching section. How to stop auto scrolling to the open accordion # If you would prefer that the Content Interface would open the Blackboard page normally. i.e. did not scroll to the top of the open accordion. Then you can add nofirstscroll to the name of the Content Interface item (Figure 1). Figure 1 - Adding nofirstscroll to the name of the Content Interface item How to change which accordions open for a visitor # If you would like a visitor to see a different accordion open when they view the page, there are two different ways you can specify this. The following sections explain these two approaches. But first, you need to understand the numbering of accordions. Numbering of accordions # Almost all Content Interface pages will have a collection of accordions. Figure 2 shows a Content Interface page with 8 accordions. To change which accordions will open for a visitor, you need to know the accordions number. Accordions are numbered from 1 up. In Figure 2, How it all works is the title for accordion #1. Open or collapsing all accordions is the title for accordion #7 Figure 2 - All the accordions for a page Expand a particular accordion # This first approach assumes that every time someone visits a page you wish to expand a particular accordion. For example, assume that when I was designing the page shown in Figure 2 I wanted the accordion with the title Opening or collapsing all accordions (accordion #7) to be expanded (open) for everyone. To do this I would add expand=7 to the name of the Content Interface item (see Figure 3) Figure 3 - Expanding a particular accordion every time someone visits Linking to a particular accordion # If I wanted to email someone information about how to stop auto scrolling in the Content Interface, I might wish to send them a link directly to accordion #4 in Figure 2. This is the accordion titled How to stop auto scrolling to the open accordion . If I sent them a link to the web page containing Figure 2 then the Content Interface might \u2013 depending on how it\u2019s configured - open the first accordion or the last accordion the visitor opened. But not accordion #4. To make sure that accordion #4 is opened, I need to add #4 to the end of the URL. For example, this URL https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?content_id=_5578515_1&course_id=_82534_1&mode=quick&content_id=_5589289_1 would become (note the #4 on the end) https://bblearn.griffith.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?content_id=_5578515_1&course_id=_82534_1&mode=quick&content_id=_5589289_1#4 Expanding or collapsing all accordions # You can also specify if a Content Interface should expand or collapse all accordions.

The following provides an overview of this process. Never change content in Blackboard, always in the Word document The biggest change is that you no longer make changes to content by editing Blackboard content items. Instead, all changes are done in the associated Word document. The basic three-step process # Which brings us to the basic three-step process you will use: Create and modify content in a Word document. Convert the Word document to HTML. Copy that HTML into Blackboard. There are two methods you can use to complete this three-step process: Entirely manual; or, Semi-automated. Which you use depends on how you set up the Content Interface. Both are illustrated below. The cost trade off # When making a small change (adding a comma or fixing a spelling mistake) this three-step process does take longer (though you get quicker with time). It costs your time. The other main cost is that it does use Microsoft Word as the authoring environment. Which brings its own cost. This cost, however, buys you additional functionality, including a better interface for students; and an editing environment that includes spell and grammar checking, citation management, version control and much more. Increasingly, there are also more specific affordance offered including University Date . A way to write generic dates like Wednesday, Week 5 (so that your content can be reused across multiple study periods) but have the right date for the current study period automatically added (to help you and students). The manual three-step process # The Content Interface code provides the overview of these three steps shown in Figure 1. The following sections illustrate those three steps. Figure 1 - Manual three steps - Content Interface instructions 1. Edit the Word document # The first step is to edit a Word document to create the content you want to place into Blackboard. How to do this is explained in more detail elsewhere. It does assume that you are familiar with styles in Word. Find out more about Word styles If you\u2019re unfamiliar with using styles in Word documents, please refer to the plethora of online resources (e.g. this one ). A quick search for introduction word styles should find most. 2. Convert the Word document into HTML # The next step is convert your Word document to HTML that is ready to pasted into your Blackboard content area. To do this, you will use this web page (Figure 2) and the following steps. Figure 2 - Mammoth conversion page Acknowledgement: The conversion of Word to HTML is enabled by a piece of open source software called Mammoth . 1. Find your Word document # Use the Browse button to locate your Word document and load it up to the web page. You may need to close your Word document Depending on your set up, the following process may not work if you have the Word document open on your computer. Your Word document never leaves your computer This service works entirely in your Web browser. Your Word document is never loaded onto another computer. 2. Check the messages and output # Once uploaded, Mammoth will convert your Word document to HTML (e.g. Figure 3). It will display some messages and the output of the conversion process. As shown in Figure 3 most messages you will see will report on element or styles from your Word document that Mammoth did not recognise. In most cases, these will be converted to a useful default. Word does provide the capability to search a document for particular styles . This may be useful if you wish to fix these issues. Mammoth produces a HTML version of your Word document. It will display it on the page. This can be useful for checking that any changes you\u2019ve made have come through. However, how the HTML looks is not representative of what it will look like in Blackboard. Figure 3 - Output of a successfully converted Word document # Use the Click to copy HTML button. This will copy the HTML produced by Mammoth into your computer\u2019s clipboard ready to be pasted into Blackboard. 4. Paste HTML into Blackboard # Having converted a Word document into HTML, it\u2019s time to paste the content into Blackboard. To do this, you would: Go to the Blackboard content area you prepared previously. Edit the Content Interface item. This document explains how to edit a Blackboard item. Paste the HTML code into this item. Using the same instructions from above for how to paste using the HTML Code View. Update and Submit the changes. Semi-automated three-step process # If you have set up your Content Interface page to include a Content Document item then you will see Figure 4 and can use the semi-automated three-step process. Figure 4 - Evidence you can use the semi-automated process Double check the Content Document link is a Word document To be sure that the semi-automate process will work, click on the Content Document item on your Blackboard page. For the semi-automated process to work, you should see an online version of the Word document. The video description of the semi-automated process # The annotated video below illustrates the semi-automated process. It assumes you\u2019ve already edited the Word document and starts from step 2. The video will pause at certain points to provide time to consider what\u2019s been shown. Press play to go to the next step. 1. Edit the Word document # Much of this is the same as editing talked about in the manual process. You use styles to create/edit content in Word. One difference - the online version # A major difference is that the Content Document points to an online version of the Word document, which you can edit. Meaning you can edit this document where ever you have access to the Web. You don\u2019t need to be at your computer. But probably only for minor edits The web-based interface for Microsoft Word is somewhat different than the normal application. You may not wish to make major edits with this interface. 2. Convert to HTML # Once you have made all the changes to the Word document you need to convert the Word document to HTML. To do this you click the Update Content Interface button as shown in Figure 4. This will start the conversion process and display something like Figure 5. If the PROGRESS section is showing all green (and, perhaps some yellow) then the conversion process has been successful and the HTML version of your content will be displayed. Figure 5 - Semi-automated conversion to HTML 3. Paste the HTML into Blackboard # Having converted the Word document to HTML, the next step is to make the change in Blackboard by pasting the HTML into Blackboard. Do this by clicking on the Click to copy & update L@G button shown in Figure 5. This button will Copy the HTML containing your updated content into your computer\u2019s clipboard. (Ready for you to paste into Blackboard) Take you back to Blackboard ready to edit the content item into which you need to paste the updated content. If step #2 works, you should see something like Figure 6. Figure 6 - Editing the content item (HTML button circled in red) Press the HTML button # Because the updated content is in HTML format, you cannot just paste it into Blackboard. You need to press the HTML button . This button is circled in red in Figure 6 and contains two angle brackets e.g. < > . You should then see something like Figure 7 pop up.

You do this by adding at least two of three content items: Content Interface (required); Where the content of your Word document will be displayed. Content Management Instructions (required); The code required to implement the Content Interface. This is also where instructions on how to use the Content Interface will appear (but only when Edit Mode is on) Content Document (optional). An appropriately shared link to the Word document for this page ( note: this currently only works for files shared via Griffith University\u2019s OneDrive/SharePoint drives) Assumed Blackboard knowledge # The following assumes that you are reasonably familiar with adding content to Blackboard Learn. In particular, that you are aware the in Blackboard a Content Area (see Figure 1) is one of the main ways to group together content. That a content area can include a number of Content Items and other content types . Assumed starting point # It is also assumed that you have created or identified a Content Area into which you wish to place the Content Interface. i.e. this is where you want your content to appear. For example, Figure 1 shows an empty Content Area that will be used throughout this process. It doesn\u2019t have to be empty The Content Interface can be added to a page that already contains other items. Your Content Area doesn\u2019t need to be empty. Figure 1 - Empty content area in Blackboard 1. Add the \u201cContent Interface\u201d content item # The Content Interface item is where the content from your Word document will be placed and where students will see it. Add a Content Item to your Blackboard page. Give it the name Content Interface and leave it empty (see the screenshot below). The name is important, make sure it\u2019s right The name \u2013 Content Interface \u2013 is used by the code to look for content it should work on. If it can\u2019t find the name, then it won\u2019t be able to do its work. Figure 2 - Creating Content Interface item 2. Add the \u201cContent Management Instructions\u201d item # The Content Management Instructions item serves two purposes: It contains the code that implements the Content Interface. It will display the instructions and support material to help you use the Content Interface (but only when Edit Mode is on). To add this item Add a new content item to your Blackboard page. Give it any name you like, but Content Management Instructions is recommended. Copy the Content Interface code from this page . Open up the HTML Code view for your content item. The HTML button is circled in red in Figure 3 Paste the Content Interface code into the HTML Code view. As shown in Figure 3. Update and submit your changes. Figure 3 - Pasting the Content Interface code What you will see \u2013 after two steps # Correctly adding these two items should result in you seeing something like Figure 4 showing the two items you have added. The main point to check is that the Content Management Instructions item should be showing a collection of instructions explaining how to use the Content Interface. This shows that the Content Interface code is operational. At this stage the Content Interface item remains empty, waiting for the content from the Word document to be placed into it. The instructions will explain (see the How to update the content card in Figure 4) how to do this using the default manual process. To automate this process more, complete the following step. Figure 4 - Content Interface set up 3. Add the Content Document item # Adding the Content Document item helps to further automate the process of updating content in Blackboard. This is achieved by providing appropriately shared link to the Word document where you are creating and editing the content. This will only work with Word documents that are shared via Griffith University OneDrive/SharePoint services. Support for other file sharing services or other institutions would require additional code to be written to work. Create a OneDrive/SharePoint shared link to the Word document # The first step is to place your Word document onto a OneDrive or SharePoint shared drive. This then enables you to create a shared link. i.e. a link that enables different collections of people to access your Word document via the Web. The aim here is to provide such a link to the Content Interface code so that it can help semi-automate the update process. Hit the Share button. This starts the process.
